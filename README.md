# Airship Engineering Practices Documentation

## TODOS:
* Document Airship's decision to adopt these guidelines.

Airship has many generalized engineering practices that cover several
languages, and frameworks across many of projects and customers. These
documents represent our collective experience of various best practices that we
have developed over time. It is possible that open source projects or other
organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to make it
available publicly when possible.

Currently this contains the following documents:

*   [Airship's Code Review Guidelines](review/index.md), which are actually three
    separate sets of documents:
    *   [The Code Reviewer's Guide](review/reviewer/index.md)
    *   [The Change Author's Guide](review/developer/index.md)
    *   [The Learning Opportunity Guide](review/learning/index.md)

## Terminology

There is some internal Airship terminology used in some of these documents, which
we clarify here for external readers:

*   **PR**: Stands for "pull-request", which means one self-contained change that
    has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
    Other organizations often call this a "change", or "patch".
*   **LGTM**: Means "Looks Good to Me". It is what a code reviewer says when
    approving a PR.
